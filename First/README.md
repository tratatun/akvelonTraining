# Akvelon Training
## The 1st week MS Nice do list

Notes for all tasks:
1) Looking for object oriented design, break down by components, abstraction, etc.

2) Design approach for production code.

3) Unit-tests are necessary (NUnit or MSTest) or (JUnit).

4) Looking for implementation of optimal algorithm with minimal complexity (ideally in one pass).

5) Implemented in a separate executable project with all the files needed to run and test the task.

___

+38. Given an array containing both positive and negative integers and required to find the sub-array
with the largest sum (O(N)). (Kadane's algoritm)

+39. Given an array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N, determine if there are any
duplicates in it and what kind. You are allowed to destroy or modify the array if you like.

+40. Write a routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making use of any floating point
computations at all.

+41. Given an integer, write a routine that prints out an chars array.

+42. Give a one-line expression to test whether a number is a power of 2 [No loops allowed - it's a
simple test.]

+43. Given an array of characters which form a sentence of words, give an efficient algorithm to reverse
the order of the words (not characters) in it.

+44. Reverse a linked list.

+45. Insert in a sorted list.

+46. Give a fast way to multiply a number by 7.

+47. Linked list manipulation: AddLast, AddAtIndex, Delete elements.

48. First some definitions for this problem: a) An ASCII character is one byte long and the most
significant bit in the byte is always '0'. b) A Kanji character is two bytes long. The only characteristic of a
Kanji character is that in its first byte the most significant bit is '1'. Now you are given an array of the
characters (both ASCII and Kanji) and, an index into the array. The index points to the start of some
character. Now you need to write a function to do a backspace (i.e. delete the character before the given
index).

+49. Delete an element from a doubly linked list.

+50. Write a function to find the depth of a binary tree.

+51. Given two strings S1 and S2. Delete from S2 all those characters which occur in S1 also and finally
create a clean S2 with the relevant characters deleted.

52. Write a small lexical analyzer - interviewer gave tokens. Expressions like "a*b" etc.

+53. Write a routine that prints out a 2-D array in spiral order.

54. Write an efficient algorithm to shuffle a pack of cards this one was a feedback process until we
came up with one with no extra storage.

+55. Given a sequence of characters. How will you convert the lower case characters to upper case
characters. (Try using bit vector)
