# Akvelon Training
## The 2nd week MS Nice do list

Notes for all tasks:
1) Looking for object oriented design, break down by components, abstraction, etc.

2) Design approach for production code.

3) Unit-tests are necessary (NUnit or MSTest) or (JUnit).

4) Looking for implementation of optimal algorithm with minimal complexity (ideally in one pass).

5) Implemented in a separate executable project with all the files needed to run and test the task.

___

+56. Write, efficient code for extracting unique elements from a sorted list of array. e.g. (1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5,
5, 9, 9, 9, 9) -> (1, 3, 5, 9).

+57. Sort an array of size n containing integers between 1 and K, given a temporary scratch integer
array of size K.

+58. Given an array of length N containing integers between 1 and N, determine if it contains any
duplicates.

59. An array of integers. The sum of the array is known not to overflow an integer. Compute the sum.
What if we know that integers are in 2's complement form?

60. An array of integers of size n. Generate a random permutation of the array, given a function
rand_n() that returns an integer between 1 and n, both inclusive, with equal probability. What is the
expected time of your algorithm?

61. An array of pointers to (very long) strings. Find pointers to the (lexicographically) smallest and
largest strings.

+62. Write a program to remove duplicates from a sorted array.

63. Given a list of numbers (fixed list). Now given any other list, how can you efficiently find out if
there is any element in the second list that is an element of the first list (fixed list).

64. Given a singly linked list, determine whether it contains a loop or not.

65. Given a singly linked list, print out its contents in reverse order. Can you do it without using any
extra space?

66. Given a binary tree with nodes, print out the values in pre-order/in-order/post-order without
using any extra space.

+67. Given a singly linked list, find the middle of the list.

68. Reverse the bits of an unsigned integer.

69. Compute the discrete log of an unsigned integer.

70. Set the highest significant bit of an unsigned integer to zero.

+71. Let f(k) = y where k is the y-th number in the increasing sequence of non-negative integers with
the same number of ones in its binary representation as y, e.g. f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 2,
f(6) = 3 and so on. Given k >= 0, compute f(k).

72. Given a 2-D array, which consists of words. Write, efficient code for generation of permutations
using an iterative and recursive algorithms. e.g. {{white, red, green},{black, grey, blue},{pink, yellow,
navy}} -> {{ white, black, pink},{ white, black, yellow}, etc.

73. Check string for palindrome. Palindrome is: mam, toyot, mm, a and so on. The string you can read
in both directions.

74. In given array find the element that occurred more the half times.

75. Convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list. We can only change the target of 
pointers, but cannot create any new nodes.

76. Please implement a function which returns mirror of a binary tree.

77. Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three prints "Fizz"
instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints "Buzz". For numbers, which are, multiples of
both three and five prints "FizzBuzz". How would you test it!

78. Write a program that prints Fibonacci series up to N number.
